# /Tutorial
# I uploaded my jupyter file for pcat_v8. I split the functions up into cells. I also figured out how to display images and get user input for the tutorial,
# but to do the rest I need to wait for the sample data. 
# I still need to figure out how to display the first/an arbitrary frame from the video to the user for the tutorial.
